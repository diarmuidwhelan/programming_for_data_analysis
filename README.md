## Diarmuid Whelan Assignment Oct 2018
### Numpy Random Package
The Programming for data analysis.ipynb file contains an examination of the Numpy.Random package. The file is a python jupyter notebook, which is an interactive python file. If there are any issues with the file you should start from the top and run the code cell by cell. The file aims to cover the following points:
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. 3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
